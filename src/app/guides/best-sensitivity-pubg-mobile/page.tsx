        <p>If you've ever searched for the "best PUBG Mobile sensitivity", you've probably found videos of professional players sharing their exact configuration codes. You copied them, went into a match, and suddenly found you couldn't hit the broad side of a barn.</p>
        
        <p>Why does this happen? Why do settings that make a pro player look like an aimbot make you feel like a complete beginner?</p>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">The Truth About Sensitivity</h2>
        <p>The hard truth is that <strong>there is no universal best sensitivity</strong>. Sensitivity is a deeply personal and hardware-dependent metric. The configuration Jonathan uses on an iPhone 14 Pro Max will not feel the same if you apply it to a Redmi Note 10.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Hardware Differences Matter</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
          <li><strong>Touch Sampling Rate:</strong> Flagship devices register your touches 240 to 480 times a second. Budget devices might only register them 120 times. This creates input lag that requires different sensitivity values to compensate.</li>
          <li><strong>Screen Size:</strong> Swiping 2 inches on a 6.8-inch display covers a different percentage of the screen than swiping 2 inches on a 6.1-inch display.</li>
          <li><strong>Gyroscope Sensors:</strong> The physical gyroscope hardware inside phones varies wildly in quality and polling rate.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">How to Find YOUR Best Sensitivity</h2>
        <p>Instead of copying settings blindly, you need to establish a baseline for your specific device tier, and then tune it based on your physical grip.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 1: Use an AI Configurator.</strong> Tools like AimSync analyze your phone model, your FPS capabilities, and your finger layout to give you a mathematically sound baseline.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Step 2: The 5% Rule.</strong> Once you have a baseline, go to the Training Grounds. If you are over-flicking (aiming past the target), lower your ADS or Camera sensitivity by 5%. If you are falling short, raise it by 5%.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-10 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Stop chasing the magic configuration code. Build your muscle memory on a baseline tailored to your hardware, and you will see your close-quarters combat and long-range sprays improve dramatically.</p>
