  } else {
    camera = `Your camera sensitivity is balanced to support both general navigation and sudden target acquisitions. It is optimized for a ${fingerCount}-finger control layout to give you steady swipe mechanics.`;

  // ADS explanation based on problems

    ads = `ADS sensitivity has been adjusted to help with pull-down mechanics. Since recoil is your primary obstacle, these values give your thumb enough leverage to easily pull down the firing button and stabilize vertical muzzle climb.`;
  } else if (primaryProblem === 'transfer') {
    ads = `ADS sensitivity is slightly dampened. This prevents your crosshair from skipping when you transition or "spray transfer" from one target to another, ensuring a smoother horizontal sweep.`;

  // Gyro explanation based on gyro usage and recoil
  if (primaryProblem === 'recoil') {
    gyro = `Gyroscope values are scaled up on mid-tier scopes (3x and 4x) by 15%. This allows you to tilt your device slightly to counter rapid vertical recoil, taking the strain off your screen-swiping finger.`;

  // ADS Gyro explanation
  if (primaryProblem === 'recoil') {
    ads_gyro = `ADS-Gyroscope values are set high. This ensures that when you press the fire button and tilt your phone simultaneously, the vertical compensation kicks in immediately to laser-focus your bullet grouping.`;
  } else if (primaryProblem === 'all') {
    ads_gyro = `ADS-Gyroscope sensitivity is fully maximized for vertical compensation, helping you lock onto targets and transfer sprays seamlessly.`;
  } else {
    ads_gyro = `ADS-Gyroscope sensitivity is mirrored to your standard Gyroscope settings. This provides visual muscle-memory consistency when transitioning between scouting and full-auto spraying.`;
